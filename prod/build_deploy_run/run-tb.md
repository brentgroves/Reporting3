## Issue

If period range script is not ran before balance update script and the period range has changed in plex. Then the balance script will be retrieving records from periods that have not been deleted in the dw. The problem will not be because of the start period because that is calculated based upon the current date.  The problem will be with the end_date because that will be greater than the value in the dw that has not been updated. When the balance script tries to add records in the new end period it will fail because these records have not been deleted.

script accounting_balance_append_period_range_dw_import retrieves period balance records based upon the plex table. The Plex.accounting_balance_delete_period_range @pcn = ?; SPROC delete dw balance record based upon the start and end period stored in the dw period table. So the sproc will not delete the actual end period records which were retrieved by the Plex accounting_balance_append_period_range_dw_import script.

Fix: Since the balance script calls the accounting_balance_append_period_range_dw_import plex sproc the Plex.accounting_balance_delete_period_range script should take the start and end period as parameters instead assuming the period update script has ran and has updated these values in the dw period table.

Util the fix is made always run the AccountingPeriodRanges script prior to running the balance or activity summary scripts.

## Corner Case

On 2/4/25 3 accounts were added and "AccountingYearCategoryType" added the records for 2025 and 2026 but did not add them for 2024. Will this be ok? Yes. The code to handle adding the records to the previous and end periods year using the end_open_period year's "AccountingYearCategoryType" new records was added some time ago for AccountPeriodBalanceRecreatePeriodRange. Added code to handle adding the previous periods year using the end_open_periods year's "AccountingYearCategoryType" new records.

## Reporting2

Tested the Reporing2 repo on 12/05/24. Removed references to mysql because I was unable to connect to mysql on reports31.

## Reason for TB

/*
Accounting_account: accounting_account_DW_Import  

This is used to determine the current accounts needed in the account_period_balance table. It has
additional fields such as the category account and sub category account that are no longer supported by
Plex. I believe the Multi-Level in the Plex Multi-Level report has to do with an account that used the
category and sub-category account.  Not supporting the category and sub-category account linkage is
the reason Southfield's Plex Multi-Level report does not show many of the accounts.

AccountingYearCategoryType:
It is used to keep track of if an account is classified as an expense or revenue for each year.
This is needed in YTD calculations which checks if an account  
is a revenue/expense to determine whether to reset YTD values to 0 for every year.

## Remove TB dependancy

Did this on Dec 2nd in Reporting2 repo because I was no longer able to ping google.com from the Avilla K8s. I told them I was going to get rid of this cluster and try to recreate one on the linamar vlan.

## Linamar change notes

From Alb-utl1, 10.1.1.1 Download the TRIALBALANCE report from plex and import it into the DW
Run Power BI report from Alb-utl4.

## Idea

/*

* Try to find any new accounts by comparing Plex.account_period_balance to Plex.accounting_account_year_category_type
* after the AccountingYearCategoryType.sh script and before the AccountPeriodBalanceRecreatePeriodRange.sh script
 */

select top 10 b.pcn,b.account_no, c.pcn,c.[year],c.account_no
from Plex.accounting_account_year_category_type c
left outer join Plex.account_period_balance b
on c.pcn = b.pcn
and c.account_no = b.account_no
where c.pcn = 123681 -- 23,063
and c.[year] = 2024
order by b.pcn

## Issue

Timeout issue with the "AccountActivitySummaryGetOpenPeriodRange"
SOAP web service script.
20240507
open-period range was 202403 to 202405. It worked on 202403 and 202404 but failed on 202405 the active period. I shutdown all apps on my dev system and ran again with no error. There maybe an issue when more than 2 Plex SOAP web services are called one after another. Or there maybe some issue with running the scripts while memory resources are low.
Had this issue again on 20241004. I ran TrialBalance-test.sh with VS Code open and all the scripts uncommented and it ran until the "AccountActivitySummaryGetOpenPeriodRange" script and then it failed. I then commented out all the scripts which ran successfully the first time and ran TrialBalance-test.sh again and it completed without any issues.

## **Format of file name**

## Note call to web service did not work until I stopped the MSSQL Server docker container

## How to Install a Virtual Environment using Venv (USE CONDA TEST ONLY)

Virtualenv is a tool to set up your Python environments. Since Python 3.3, a subset of it has been integrated into the standard library under the venv module. You can install venv to your host Python by running this command in your terminal:

pip install virtualenv
To use venv in your project, in your terminal, create a new project folder, cd to the project folder in your terminal, and run the following command:

```bash
# add env/ folder to gitignore
conda deactivate
pushd .
cd ~/src/Reporting2/prod/volume/PipeLine
# python3.8 -m venv env if multiple versions of python are installed using deadsnakes ppa
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install pyodbc
```

```bash
# usage ./TrialBalance-test.sh "TB" "<bgroves@buschegroup.com>" "202201" "202301" 0 "once"

# If start_period_update = 1 the AccountingStartPeriodUpdate script will run

./TrialBalance-test.sh "TB" "bgroves@buschegroup.com" "202402" "202502" 0 "once"
```

## run dbeaver

open azure_account_period_balance_validate.sql and mysql_trial_balace_validation.sql
follow steps

```bash
/*

* Detected an error on 03/09/2023:
* no_update = 1 but there were no 2023-01 balance records at all.
* The daily scripts were not running during this period.
* Until the scripts are running again run the TrialBalance pipeline
* with start_period_update = 0 so all the balance records will be
* pulled from Plex everytime.

## Update MySQL Trialbalance table with Plex CSV

Still working on this CsvToTrialBalanceMultiLevel script. Delete and inserts are working so next pass start_period and end_period to shell script. Copy Trial_Balance to ~/src/Reporting directory for now.
It looks like it inserts the records ok now I need to delete the periods in the table before inserting the new records.

Hi Dan,
Are you expecting to see any changes between this TB and the one I sent you on the 13th? I'm asking because I didn't see any changes between the two but that does not mean there could not have been updates it only means there were no updates that show up in the Plex version of the TB.  So, if the changes happened on accounts that are not displayed in the Plex version of the TB then there could still be changes between this TB and the one I sent on the 13th.
